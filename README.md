# Weird Proxies

It's a cheat sheet about behaviour of various reverse proxies and related attacks.

It is a result of analysis of various reverse proxies, cache proxies, load balancers, etc.
The article (https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/a-fresh-look-on-reverse-proxy-related-attacks/) describes the goals of the research and how you can use the cheat sheet.
